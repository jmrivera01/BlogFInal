    <p>The Great Nikola Tesla</p>
    <p>Nikola Tesla has been one of my greatest inspiration. As a scientist myself, I admire all the hard work he did and recieved so little credit for it. He gave us the alternating current motor while working under the hands of Edison who was working with direct current. Tesla was working with alternating current and its many applications. He is also known for the Tesla Coil, the beginngins of neon lights and believe it or not even the technology that powers our remotes. </p>
